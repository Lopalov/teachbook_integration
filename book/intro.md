This book can be used as a template for other books. It includes a starter package of the software developed by the TeachBooks initiative and some exercises to get you going!

```{math}
\vec{F}(\vec{r}, t) = -\nabla \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{\rho(\vec{r}\,')}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}\,'|} \, d^3\vec{r}\,' \right)
+ \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \nabla^n \left( \frac{\partial^{n-1} \vec{J}(\vec{r}, t)}{\partial t^{n-1}} \right) \right)
