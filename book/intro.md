# Course Description

Big Data is mostly obtained from features of components and the interactions between components in large complex systems. Examples are (1) end user features and interactions in both online and real-world social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn (2) data from content sharing platforms such as YouTube (3) physiological data of the brain and (4) stock prices etc. in economic systems. Such a dataset is networked in nature i.e. the data of the system components or interactions are (cor)related to each other.

This course introduces the basic methodologies to analyze, model, interpret and predict such Networked Data that enable us to further intervene or optimise the system, combining advances from network science, modeling of dynamic processes and statistical physics, beyond machine learning algorithms. These methods will be applied to diverse real-world datasets obtained from e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, the brain etc.

## Expected prior knowledge

The assignment and final project require basic programming skill.
