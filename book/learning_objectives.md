# Learning Objectives

After this course, students could construct a network based on the dataset, characterize and model the network in order to e.g. detect patterns and anomalies, model the data via dynamic processes (e.g. viral spreading) on networks to decode the underlying governing mechanisms of e.g. information/error/behavior contagion and to predict e.g. the popularity of a product, news, disease, computer virus, control the contagion process such as maximize the information prevalence and market share.

Students could obtain an overview of the Msc/Phd projects on the frontiers of networked data analysis.
