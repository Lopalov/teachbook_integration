# Assessment

The final grade of the course consists of the following components:

*   Assignments (weighting 20%)
*   Final project (weighting 80%)

Final grade calculation: 0.2 \* Assignments + 0.8 \* Final project

*   **F** is the final grade
*   **A** is the assignment grade
*   **P** is the final project grade

Final Grade Calculation:

```{math}
F = 0.2 \cdot A + 0.8 \cdot P
```

A passing final grade for the course can only be earned when for all components at least a 5.0 is earned, and the weighted final grade is at least a 5.8.

Resit/ Repair opportunities:

In case of an insufficient final result, repair opportunities may be offered in accordance with TER Implementation Regulations Art 5, sub 5., for:

*   Assignments: re-submit deliverable
*   Final project: re-submit deliverable

Disclaimer: information may change depending on unforeseen circumstances or measures (see: TER Art 29, sub 4).

In case the assignment or project is not submitted on time, which means it won’t be evaluated, there won’t be any repair opportunity.
