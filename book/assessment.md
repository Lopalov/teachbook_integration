# Assessment

The final grade of the course consists of the following components:

*   Assignments (weighting 20%)
*   First project (weighting 40%)
*   Final project (weighting 40%)

Final Grade Calculation:

*   **F** is the final grade
*   **A** is the assignment grade
*   **P{sub}`1`** is the first project grade
*   **P{sub}`2`** is the final project grade

```{math}
F = 0.2 \cdot A + 0.4 \cdot P_1 + 0.4 \cdot P_2
```

A passing final grade for the course can only be earned when for all components at least a 5.0 is earned, and the weighted final grade is at least a 5.8.
